Final-Assignment for Data Analytics in Finance Bootcamp Greece by Workearly 

This project is designed to simulate a full workflow of a Data Analyst from getting data off the Database to manipulate it with the use of Python and Pandas module to present it through matplotlib module or Tableau.

The concept is that we are given a dataset that contains Liquor Sales in the state of Iowa in USA between 2012-2020 and we are asked to find the most popular item per zipcode and the percentage of sales per store in the period between 2016-2019.

We are also asked to visualize the Data and present them in either a matplotlib format or in Tableau Public.

-> I chose to utilize matplotlib and seaborn.

Every calculation and transformation of Data has to happen through a Python Script.


- ###### Step 1.

Added the Dataset provided to Workbench.

- ###### Step 2.

Used a Query to get all the columns of the table between the years 2016-2019

- ###### Step 3.

Exported the data to an CSV file.

- ###### Step 4.

Used Python and Pandas to Aggregate the CSV data to get the most popular item sold based on zip code and percentage of sales per store.

- ###### Step 5.

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn with the newly made CSV file and present Data.

- ###### Step 6.

Uploaded the visualization app via Streamlit.
